# Coding Interview Preparation

This repository is a comprehensive collection of data structures, algorithms, design patterns, coding problems, and Java core concepts designed to aid in preparation for coding interviews. It covers a wide range of topics and includes solutions to problems from popular platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- `corejava`: This package contains sub-packages for various core Java concepts like collections, generics, lambda expressions, Stream API, multithreading, exceptions, I/O, networking, serialization, reflection, and annotations. It also includes sub-packages for Java 11 and Java 17 features.
- `datastructures`: This package contains implementations of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, and tries.
- `algorithms`: This package contains implementations of various algorithms like sorting, searching, greedy, dynamic programming, backtracking, divide and conquer, and bit manipulation algorithms.
- `designpatterns`: This package contains examples of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns, as well as examples demonstrating the SOLID principles.
- `leetcode`: This package contains solutions to LeetCode problems.
- `geeksforgeeks`: This package contains solutions to GeeksforGeeks problems.
- `interviews`: This package contains sub-packages for company-specific interview questions and online coding tests/challenges.
- `tests`: This package contains practice tests and mock interviews.
