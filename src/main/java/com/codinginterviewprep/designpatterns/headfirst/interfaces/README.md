# Duck Behavior Refactoring using the Strategy Pattern

## Problem Description
In the current implementation, we have several duck classes (e.g., `MallardDuck`, `RedHeadDuck`, `RubberDuck`) that share common behavior methods (`fly()` and `quack()`). However, this approach leads to duplicate code and violates the Open/Closed Principle.

## Issues with the Current Approach
1. **Duplicate Code**:
    - The `fly()` and `quack()` methods are duplicated across different duck classes.
    - If we need to modify the behavior, we must make changes in multiple places.

2. **Maintenance Challenges**:
    - Managing duplicate code becomes cumbersome as the number of duck subclasses increases.
    - Lack of flexibility in adapting behavior without modifying existing classes.

## Solution: The Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern allows us to address these issues by:
- Encapsulating behavior (e.g., flying, quacking) into separate classes (strategies).
- Dynamically composing behaviors with duck objects.
- Achieving better code reusability and maintainability.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Separate Behaviors**:
    - Create separate behavior classes (implementing `FlyBehavior` and `QuackBehavior` interfaces or abstract classes).
    - Define specific behavior implementations (e.g., `FlyWithWings`, `QuackLoudly`, `Squeak`).

2. **Composition**:
    - In each duck class, use composition to hold references to behavior objects.
    - Define instance variables for `flyBehavior` and `quackBehavior`.

3. **Dynamic Behavior Assignment**:
    - Set behavior dynamically at runtime (via setter methods or constructor arguments).
    - Change behavior without modifying duck classes.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile and run the duck simulation.
3. Observe how different ducks exhibit various behaviors.
